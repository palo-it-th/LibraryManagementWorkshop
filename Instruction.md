**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Book Management:** Librarians should be able to add, update, delete, and view books in the library. Each book will have attributes like ISBN, title, author, publisher, and status (available or borrowed).

2. **Borrow and Return Books:** Users should be able to borrow and return books. The system should update the status of the book accordingly.

3. **Search:** Users should be able to search for books by title, author, or ISBN.


Then refactor it into appropriate packages and folder such as model, service, repository, controller, and exception.

Don't use filed injection, use constructor injection instead.
